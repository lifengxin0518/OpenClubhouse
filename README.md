# OpenClubhouse

A third-party open web application based on flask to play Clubhouse audio for [https://opench.aix.uy](https://opench.aix.uy).

## Statement

This is a third-party Clubhouse audio player. I hope that everybody can hear the voice. So it is a open Clubhouse client for Android, for Desktop Computer, and for anyone without invite code.

All room accesses are acquired from my personal session, and all copyrights of the voice are belongs to JoinClubhouse.com and its users.

If you have any question or suggestion, issues are welcome.
